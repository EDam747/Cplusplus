Summarize the project and what problem it solves.

This project efficiently keeps track of the inventory of an imaginary grocery store by keeping a count of how often each item is purchased. This subsequently makes it easier  to search for specific items, see the frequencies of each item, and additionally view a histogram for a visual example of this system. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What did you do particularly well?
I read over my code mutiple times to ensure it is organized and as easy to comprehend as possible so that future changes are easy to make if needed or if the system needs an upgrade. There is also a backup installed of the data for safety purposes to cover any potential losses.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
An area that could be improved would be better handling of file issues that would in turn make the program more reliable. A smaller tweak that would make things smoother would be to change the maps search function to make searching for items smoother and faster.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Understanding how to incorporate a file into the code base was a complicated addition that I have not done regularly that I overcame.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?

A first in this project that I didn't have experience with before was working around and with maps and weaving files into code. These are potentially useful areas that would need additional development to be more comfortable with and executed in a cleaner fashion when needed in the future.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Making small comments on important functions to ensure there is no confusion is a good way to maintain a clean code that can be customized as needed in the future if needed.
